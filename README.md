# Rock_VS_Mine
Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project is a Machine Learning model built with Logistic Regression to classify objects detected by a sonar signal as either a Rock (R) or a Mine (M).

📌 Features
Uses the Sonar dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository).
Preprocessing of data using Pandas & NumPy.
Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.
Model training with Logistic Regression (Scikit-Learn).
Evaluation with accuracy score on both training and test data.
A simple predictive system to test custom input values.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn

🚀 How It Works

Load the dataset (sonar_data.csv).

Preprocess and split into features & labels.

Train the Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate performance on training & testing sets.

Input custom sonar readings to classify as Mine or Rock.

📊 Results

Prints accuracy scores for training and test sets.

Allows user-defined input for real-time predictions.

🏆 Applications
